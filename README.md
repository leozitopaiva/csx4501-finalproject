This repository is intended to store my final project of the UCLA Data Science Class

# Introduction of my research question
I would like to know if theire is a correlation between how many calories a person can burn vs their weight, while being expoused to the same intensity, excercity type, conditions, and time.


# Why it is important to me, why it matters to others, and what is at stake
It is important to me because I have been excercising for a year along with other friends, following the same diet strategy, and following a spefic traning program. We also have been using smart tracker to record metrics of our body and performance. After we start to share our results, I noticed that during the same workout the range of burned calory is very different. I think it matters to others, because if this teory confirms, each person can have personalized workouts to achive their goals.

# Description of data sources that I will use
I am planning to use a dataset that contains data of activities and exercise performed by people with different weight at the same intensity and time.

# Potential data sources with links

# A scope that explains the intended analysis and resulting visualizations for your project
During this research I am looking for performing analisys on datasets that contains usable data related to people expoused to exercises and be able to compare how many calories each group will burn according to their weight.

# What insights I expect to gain from your research
Each personare different and when it cames to well-being have data to drive better decisions of everyone's life matters. As expectactions of this research, I want to be able to identify is there is correlation between weight and calorries burned.
